``<libmaple/nvic.h>``
=====================

Nested Vector Interrupt Controller (NVIC) support.

The same API is used on all targets, but the available interrupts are
target-dependent. To manage this, each target series defines an
:ref:`nvic_irq_num <libmaple-nvic-nvic_irq_num>` enumerator for each
available interrupt.

``nvic_irq_num``
----------------

This target-dependent enum is used to identify an interrupt vector
number.  Interrupts which are common across series have the same token
(though not necessarily the same value) for their ``nvic_irq_num``\ s.
The available values on each supported target series are as follows.

Register Maps
-------------

Since the NVIC is part of the ARM core, its registers and base pointer
are common across all targes.
